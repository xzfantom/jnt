          <p class="subheader">
            Achieving your goals without stress or fear using Guided Intuition
          </p>
          <p>
            We live in a reality defined by probability theory. Every moment,
            our choices move us through an invisible maze of branching
            realities. We are blindly navigating an infinite set of paths that
            lead to every possible outcome, including the one we want most. Our
            intuition is the key to navigating that maze successfully. Our
            biggest is our own fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intuition is a powerful navigational tool that we seldom use. It can
            accurately lead us towards any goal that we set. Listening to it is
            a skill that can be developed. However, intuition requires guidance.
            It needs to know where we want to go and it will listen to the
            strongest signal it can find. We create a signal by setting a goal.
            If we set our goal correctly, it will accelerate the speed at which
            our intuition will navigate towards it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, our fear is sending its own powerful signal as well. The
            good news is that we can learn to minimize or even disable that
            signal. Guided Intuition can give us complete control of our lives
            and allows us to achieve any goal we can imagine. This book will
            explain how.

              The regular chaos of life can be overwhelming for some of us.
              Control is not always possible. The options facing us everyday can
              be maddening. It can cause enormous stress and frustration. For
              some, it can lead to depression and even suicidal thoughts when it
              all gets too much.

              successfully towards them without stress or fear. It will show you
              how to embrace change instead of avoiding it. Most importantly,
              you will learn how to trust yourself deeply.

          <p>
            People with low self-esteem struggle to believe in themselves. They
            feel that they are never good enough or suffer from imposter
            syndrome. They are afraid of failure or making mistakes. They avoid
            risk and are afraid of change. They cling to the few things they
            feel that they can control. They have dreams of being much more but
            are afraid to pursue them. The fact is that any goal can be reached,
            if you know the right choices that will reliably lead you there but
            knowing the right choices feels like an overwhelming challenge.
            However, we live in a multi-dimensional reality of infinite
            probabilities. There are many timelines we might follow, forming an
            impossibly complex maze. We cannot see that maze because our
            conscious mind is limited to only three dimensions. If we were able
            to see in four dimensions that still wouldn’t be enough. Or even
            five.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would have to be able to see in 6 dimensions before the maze
            would be fully understandable. And there is a part of us that lives
            in 6 dimensions and can see that maze - it’s our intuition. Our
            intuition knows where a given choice will ultimately lead. However,
            it will navigate to the place we BELIEVE we will go, not the place
            we WISH we will go. If we train ourselves to harness our intuition
            and we focus on having conviction about our destination, all
            obstacles will fall away. The actual discipline is in agreeing to
            make the right choice, to commit to it. To leave behind the fear
            that stands in our way and trust that your path is the right one for
            you.
